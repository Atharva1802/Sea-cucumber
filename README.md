# Project Seagull

Fishing is among the most dangerous of all professions, accident statistics also support this statement, every year, thousands of fishermen die due to the numerous amounts of threats their job poses before them, be it a vessel disaster or a mechanical failure or an attack by the predators of the sea.  Our solution focuses on using artificial intelligence and machine learning to make up a software which in turn will save the lives of these fishermen who are in a constant danger of getting attacked by deadly creatures of the sea.
## Outline
- The attack of marine animals on swimmers
- Approach
- Solution Proposal
- Working methodology
- Next Steps

## The Problem
Thermal cameras exist to track warm blooded species. However, in ocean most of the species are cold blooded. There exist a threat to the people who swim in sea, near the coast, getting attacked by sharks and saltwater crocodiles. Threat posed to swimmers and small scale fishermen by dangerous aquatic organisms has not shrunk in figures,
dangerous aquatic organisms may be encountered during recreational use of freshwater and at coastal environments.

## Approach
- For the most effective use of the project, high resolution cameras need to be installed at the shallow seabed and in the coral reefs, also monitoring systems like, ultrasonic detectors and LIDAR can be of great help in generationg clear images and data about the marine life that is presentt underwater at a given time.
- Moreover, its pattern recognition AI model can also be trained further for scuba divers to identify, recognize and grade (1 -10) the threat posed by a certain species.
- With the help of sirens and beacons installed on floats and buoys near the cost and in the middle of the ocean, People nearby will be alerted of any dangerous species that is present underwater.

    
## Solution Proposal
Our solution focuses on using artificial intelligence and Machine Learning to make a software which  in turn will save lives of swimmers and fishermen who are in constant danger of getting attacked by creatures of the sea.
- Project seagull works on image processing through pattern recognition AI, to identify the marine species present underwater.
- Layered CNN is used with a dataset of some marine species, which recognizes marine species with average accuracy of 94.45%.
- Once a species is recognized, it will be recognized by its name and will be given a threat level tag (0 â€“ 10).
- After detecting the Marine species, if it would have a threat level of greater significance, Swimmers and fishermen will be alerted via Sirens and horns.
- For example, if  a box jellyfish (venomous) is detected, siren will blow and evacuation of the area will be requested.
  ### Tech used
  - We have used Tensorflow Keras, as a base for the model.
  - ML model is sequential type.
  - Flask will be used to develop Web Application. 
  - CNN with  8 convolutional layers 4 hidden layers and 1 output layer is used.
  - HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be used for web page.
