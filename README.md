# Sea-cucumber
Fishing is among the most dangerous of all professions, accident statistics also support this statement, every year, thousands of fishermen die due to the numerous amounts of threats their job poses before them, be it a vessel disaster or a mechanical failure or an attack by the predators of the sea.  Our solution focuses on using artificial intelligence and machine learning to make up a software which in turn will save the lives of these fishermen who are in a constant danger of getting attacked by deadly creatures of the sea.
We're working on the implementation of a CNN (convolutional neural network) which we will train using a dataset of shallow and deep sea creatures, and then using image processing and pattern recognition, the model will be able to predict the name and index of threat from that creature, For example if a reef shark is detected by the algorithm, it will have a low threat level.  
This will not only help the fishermen who fish in their boats with their teams, but also help solo fishermen, who everyday go out in the open sea and risk their lives on their little fragile kayaks. We intend for this solution to be a life saver for the fishermen's community and believe that AI and ML will definitely have another real world effective use-case.
